For some reason she just really feel a jump in her ego when she walk through those doors. Trying to find a new class room in live minutes was about the hardest thing that day, although as mean as some o them looked, all she had to do was ask an upper classman and she would know right were to go. Times fly she has a many friends that who can understand her well. She studied at Casiguran, Technical, Vocational, School 1st year until she graduates at a With Honors and awards. Gruta journey in College is very challenging because its not her dream course but because of her family she pursued the criminology cause she love her family.

                                        <p>Plagiarism is bad because it devalues the work of others. It's like taking someone else’s words, ideas and content without giving credit for their effort. It also violates the copyright laws in some countries, which can lead to legal action and fines. Plagiarized content is also bad for SEO because when a site does not have original content, it makes the page less valuable to search engines and visitors. It can also hurt the reputation of your website and the trustworthiness of the site as a whole.</p>

                                        <p>1. Collect Your Sources and References Together As we have already mentioned, there are cases when writers or students forget to refer to sources, and they unintentionally plagiarize. It is easily avoidable if you create a list of references and link them to your outline parts. After you align sources with your H2-H3, mark what needs to be quoted, paraphrased, hyperlinked, or included in the footer. Planning is a half-the-battle won! You should include the step of source collecting in your writing workflow</p>
                                        <p>2. Quote The quote is a word used to describe the act of copying a piece of text verbatim and inserting it into your writing. This text should be enclosed in quotation marks and correctly attributed to the original author. Quote sparingly - only use quotes when necessary to drive home a point or illustrate a specific example. When you include a quote in your writing, it is crucial to ensure that the content is original and accurately quoted. Use quotation marks in the content and cite the source. Also, if you are doing academic work, do not forget to include the author's name and date of publication in one sentence. For content, you can simply identify the source name. There are multiple citation styles for citations, but the most common one is the APA style.</p>

                                        <p>There are several potential consequences for plagiarism when it comes to SEO. First and foremost, plagiarizing content can get you penalized by Google. This means that your website will rank lower in search engine results pages (SERPs), making it much harder for people to find you. In addition, plagiarism can also cause your site to be removed from Google's index altogether, meaning that it will no longer appear in search results. Aside from the potential penalties from Google, plagiarizing content can also lead to legal trouble. If you're caught copying someone else's work without giving them credit, you may be subject to fines or even imprisonment. And if you steal someone else's copyrighted material and use it on your website, you could face lawsuits from the copyright holder. Finally, plagiarism is just bad for business overall. It makes you look like a dishonest or lazy person, and it can turn away potential customers and clients. So, not only will plagiarism hurt your SEO efforts, but it can also hurt your bottom line.</p>

                                <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software. Computer viruses aim to disrupt systems, cause major operational issues, and result in data loss and leakage. A key thing to know about computer viruses is that they are designed to spread across programs and systems. Computer viruses typically attach to an executable host file, which results in their viral codes executing when a file is opened. The code then spreads from the document or software it is attached to via networks, drives, file-sharing programs, or infected email attachments.</p>

                                <p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to software specifically designed to harm, exploit, or disrupt devices, networks, or systems. It comes in various forms, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware, each serving unique malicious purposes. Viruses spread by attaching to files or programs, worms replicate themselves across networks, and Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software to trick users into installing them. Ransomware encrypts a victim's data and demands payment for decryption, while spyware secretly monitors activities to steal sensitive information like passwords or financial details.</p>
